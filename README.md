# anino_exam_dataeng

This repository serves as my technical test for the role of Data Engineer Intern at Anino.

The repository contains 3 files, a Python file, an SQL file, and a PDF file.

Python file
    - code.py
    - contains pandas dataframe that was used to process the initial csv file that was given.
    - PostgreSQL did not load and MySQL took too long to process the csv file so I resorted to Pandas

SQL file
    - queries.sql
    - contains the answers to the questions asked in the exam specs
    - list of queries that were tested in MySQL with incomplete data since data importing was cancelled due to taking too long of a time

PDF file
    - Jose_Anino_DataEnggExam_Documentation.pdf
    - contains additional comments on the SQL file
    - better to look at this file instead of the SQL file since this file is color coded and has more comments
